                        The X axis of the graph represents the days we see in a season. Each episode is typically a day. On the Y axis is the year, 33 years apart. Events that take place between two years are not on the timeline. Since a character can typically only travel in exact 33 year increments, all characters experience the days on the X-axis the same, no matter what year. A day where they are in 1986 means they are not in 2019 for a day. We can then represent the year seperately from the day.

                        Each dot on the graph is an event - something a character does that is important. These are most often on-screen events, though there are several off-screen events shown. There is not an event for every time we see a character on-screen. Some scenes are just not relevant to this graph. A break in a character's line means we do not know where they travel or what they do in this time, for example Noah's timeline in season 1.

                        The graph suggests the different times as parallel, but this is only how it is displayed. The below MS Paint diagram explains the representation of the timeline.

        <p>I'll start putting Season 3 on the graph during my first re-watch of the new season, it may be a few weeks after it releases.</p> 
        <p>As of this writing, Season 3 is not out. It may be that Season 3 contains so much non-33-year time travel that I will have trouble representing it with the current paradigm. If this is the case, I will need to take time to rethink and reimplement how I represent the timeline, which will take time.</p>

        <p>I have not included characters who would only have one or two events. If their contribution to the story can be represented by the other characters in the scene, they will not be on the timeline. </p>
        <p>I originally planned to include objects, such as Michael's Letter, and the Tannhaus machine. I realized that the timelines for the objects were not interesting because they moved through the different years - they were interesting because they persisted over 33 years to exist multiple times at the same point. This is difficult to represent with this graph, so they were not included. </p>
        <p>Also, we do not know the chronology of the Tannhaus Machine exactly. Many characters have owned it in parallel, and we do not know the order. Perhaps I will include it after Season 3.</p>

        <p>This site is made with Bootstrap. The timeline is made using a chart library called Chart.js which renders the chart in a canvas element, with heavy customization from me for tooltips and legend. The back end uses Node and Express, with a MongoDB database. Webpack bundles the front-end files. I used React for the interface I use to edit the timeline.</p>
        <p>I learned most of my web dev skills from Colt Steele's excellent <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> on Udemy, though I have been independently developing my skills for several months since taking that course.</p>
        <p>I don't actually consider myself a programmer, I am trained as a theatrical sound engineer. This is merely a hobby for me. If you have any comments on the programming side of things, please let me know.</p>

        <p>This isn't a real F.A.Q. question, I just wanted to share my opinion.</p>
        <p>Based purely on Seasons 1 and 2, I believe the timeline to be purely deterministic. I believe everything happens exactly once, and nothing can be changed. The characters have no free will, and are purely living out their destiny. There is no time loop, we haven't seen anything happen twice. There are, however, many causal loops. Tannhaus could only finish the machine because he had the already finished machine. I also believe any character who thinks they can change things are either deluded or misinformed. We haven't seen anything change yet.</p>
        <p>I paid close attention to the language around cycles while making this timeline, as it most easily disproves my theory. I think (I'm not sure) that rather than referring to the events happening again, a cycle is a period of time with active time travel. Season 1 was the first cycle, Season 2 the second, Season 3 the third. I could be very wrong about this.</p>
        <p>Season 3 will probably completely invalidate my concept of the timeline. I look forward to finding out how it all really works.</p>
